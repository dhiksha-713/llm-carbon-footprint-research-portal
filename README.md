# LLM Carbon Footprint Study (Green AI)

This project uses a RAG based approach to evaluate how accurately large language models report and synthesize information about their carbon footprint and energy usage.

## Domain

Green AI / Sustainable Computing

## Research Question

How do we accurately measure and compare the carbon footprint of different LLMs across their lifecycle?

## Tasks

**Task 1: Claim–Evidence Extraction**

* Extract grounded claims
* Provide verbatim evidence
* Ensure citation accuracy

**Task 2: Cross-Source Synthesis**

* Compare research papers
* Identify methodological agreements and disagreements

## Models Evaluated

* Claude Opus 4.5
* Claude Sonnet 4.5
* GPT-5
* Gemini 3

## Project Structure

* `docs/` – Framing brief, evaluation sheet, prompt kit
* `prompts/` – Baseline and structured prompts
* `results/` – Model outputs and evaluation scores
* `notebooks/` – Analysis and comparison

## Key Finding

Structured prompts significantly improve grounding, citation accuracy, and format compliance across all models.
